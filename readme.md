# Macro Lang repository

Macro Lang is a programming language created only for fun.

Is not completed and has the only intention of be used for educational reason.

AT NO POINT THIS CODE AND WHAT REPRESENTS should be used for other thing than learning.

You are welcome to change, improve, modify or add code to it.

But, again, this code will not evolve to become a final, usable, programming language.
